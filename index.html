    <h1>The Meaning of Norms and Exceptions</h1>
    <p>Cairo summarizes data exploration as "find[ing] patterns and trends lurking in the data and then observe[ing] the deviations
    from those patterns. A datum that comforms to the pattern is considered part of the norm and a datum that doesn't do so is deemed
    an exception. Cairo states that "interesting stories may arise form both."</p>
    <h2>The Mode, the Median, and the Mean</h2>
    <h3>Modes</h3>
    <p>These measures of central tendency are used to gain insight on data distribution. Cairo deems the mode to be the most simple of 
    the three, likely as there isn't much mathematical jiggery pokery involed beyond counting. The mode of a set of data is which value
    appears most often within the set. If you're really into modes and want a report on them from the text, then Cairo states that the mode
    of Ideb (an index used by Brazil to measure school quality) data is apparently a 4.0 out of a possible 10. Cool, huh! By this measure,
    anything close to a 4 is normal and any datum further away is exceptional.</p>
    <h3>Medians</h3>
    <p>My man Alberto also learns us fools on what a median is. The median value is the value that divides the other values into two
      halves when ordered numerically; valuable info, right? He describes the median as a resistant statistic as it isn't sensitive to 
      exceptional values.
    <h3>Means</h3>
    <p>The mean, known on the street as the "average," is the result of adding up all the values and divinding the result by the
      number of values. Cairo warns any abusers of this statistic that it is easily distorted by exceptional values. To give a "report"
      on this, the book demonstrates this by analysing some starting salaries of geography grads frm UNC Chapel Hill. The mean starting
      salary from the data is $740,000. The mean value differs greatly from the median value of $30,000.
      Is the geography program there that highly prized or did the author purposefully use a very small sample size and an exceptional 
      value?</p>
