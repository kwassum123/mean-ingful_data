    <h1>The Meaning of Norms and Exceptions</h1>
    <p>Cairo summarizes data exploration as "find[ing] patterns and trends lurking in the data and then observe[ing] the deviations
    from those patterns. A datum that comforms to the pattern is considered part of the norm and a datum that doesn't do so is deemed
    an exception. Cairo states that "interesting stories may arise form both."</p>
    <h2>The Mode, the Median, and the Mean</h2>
    <h3>Modes</h3>
    <p>These measures of central tendency are used to gain insight on data distribution. Cairo deems the mode to be the most simple of 
    the three, likely as there isn't much mathematical jiggery pokery involed beyond counting. The mode of a set of data is which value
    appears most often within the set. If you're really into modes and want a report on them from the text, then Cairo states that the mode
    of Ideb (an index used by Brazil to measure school quality) data is apparently a 4.0 out of a possible 10. Cool, huh! By this measure,
    anything close to a 4 is normal and
